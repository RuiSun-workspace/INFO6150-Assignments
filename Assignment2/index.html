            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is RUI SUN, currently a student majoring in Software Engineering at 
           Northeastern University. I have a solid foundation in computer science 
           including C/C++, data structures, operating systems, computer networks, and databases. 
           I am proficient in program design, software testing, and web development, with practical 
           experience in both academic projects and internships. 
           With strong learning ability, teamwork spirit, and problem-solving skills, I am eager to
